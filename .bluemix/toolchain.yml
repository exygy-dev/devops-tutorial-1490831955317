name: "DevOps Tutorial Toolchain"
description: "[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) is a methodology that aims to improve development and operational efficiencies while enhancing partnership with customers. DevOps is more than doing the same things faster; it establishes a delivery pipeline that spans from ideation to monitoring. \n\nTo start working from a DevOps approach, use the DevOps Tutorial Application project. You'll get a project in [IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net) that is built by using the latest tools, deployed to [IBM Bluemix](https://bluemix.net), and has the foundation for test, scalability, and operations.\n\nThe application is a simple Node.js [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/) sample that you can extend. This sample code is used in a [tutorial](https://method.mybluemix.net/devops/method/tutorials/tutorial_automated) that explains how to configure a toolchain to use for cloud native development in DevOps Services and Bluemix. \n\nTo get started, click **Create**."
